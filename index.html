<h2> Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffer texture.
    </li>
    <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Cooking the omellete: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs.Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
    <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omellete.</li>
    <li>Fold and serve: As the omellete continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate. </li>
    <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
